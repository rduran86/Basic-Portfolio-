			<p> 6+ years of experience working as a Control Systems Engineer, when started working at Cymer in San Diego, CA. I have been exposed to Software Development with C++ and Python which motivated me to increase my skills in the Web Applications development since both areas have a lot of gorwth and great opportunities. I would like to have an open horizon of possibilities	
			<br> <br><br>
			I have a very busy life at home since I have 3 beautiful daughters and wife to take care of. I am really glad to be part of the coding bootcamp and look forward to learn a lot.
